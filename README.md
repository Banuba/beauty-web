# WebAR/Beauty demo app

Try it Live: [banuba.github.io/beauty-web](https://banuba.github.io/beauty-web)

![WebAR/Beauty preview](preview.png)

The demo app is built on top of [Banuba WebAR SDK](https://docs.banuba.com/far-sdk/tutorials/development/basic_integration?platform=web) and [Makeup](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/effect_api/makeup) effect. It reveals common patterns of consuming the [WebAR SDK JavaScript API](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/generated/typedoc/) as well as the [Makeup effect API](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/effect_api/makeup).

Investigation of the app codebase can give you ready to go snippets for common tasks like:

- [Preloading of WebAR modules](index.html#L61-L65)
- [Preloading of a WebAR effect](index.html#L66)
- [Using different image inputs](index.html#L94-101)
- [Taking screenshots](index.html#102-105)
- [Optimizing WebAR for HiDPI devices](index.html#L58)
- [Applying of user provided images as Background texture](index.html#L123)
- [Invoking Makeup effect APIs](index.html#L125)
